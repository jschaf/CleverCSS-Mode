(defconst clevercss-version "0.1"
  "`clevercss-mode' version number.")

;; This file is not part of GNU Emacs.

;;; Commentary:

;; This is a major mode for editing CleverCSS files.  Much of the
;; functionality imitates that of `clevercss-mode'.  `clevercss-mode'
;; provides support for imenu and hideshow.

;;; Installation:

;; - Put `clevercss.el' somewhere in your emacs load path
;; - Add these lines to your .emacs file:
;;   (autoload 'clevercss-mode "clevercss nil t)
;;   (add-to-list auto-mode-alist '("\\.pcss\\'" . clevercss-mode))
;;  
;; This mode assumes that CleverCSS files have the suffix ".pcss".
;; You may use additional suffixes by adding them to
;; `auto-mode-alist'.  For example, to add the suffix ".ccss" you
;; would write the following in your .emacs file:
;; 
;; (add-to-list auto-mode-alist '("\\.ccss\\'" . clevercss-mode))
;;
;; To customize how it works:
;;  M-x customize-group RET clevercss-mode RET
;;

;;; Bug Reporting:

;; Patches welcome.

;;; History:

;; Apr 2010 - Created

;;; Todo:
;; Fix font-lock for opening block css selectors.  It's a hack.
;; Add imenu support (wishlist)
;; Add compilation support

;;; Code:
